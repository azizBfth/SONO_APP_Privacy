###Privacy Policy
###Introduction
Emka-TECH built the SONO_TRACKing app as a free app. This Service is provided by SONOTRAK at no cost and is intended for use as is. This page informs users regarding our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. By using the Service, you agree to the terms described in this policy.

###Information Collection and Use
We do not collect any personally identifiable information from users of this app. The app does not request or store your name, email address, location, gender, pictures, or any other personal data.

However, some third-party services (such as Google Play Services) may collect anonymous diagnostic data to ensure proper functionality. These third-party tools are governed by their own privacy policies.

###Cookies
This app does not use cookies directly. However, third-party components integrated into the app may use cookies to enhance performance or analytics. You can choose to accept or refuse these cookies via your device settings.

###Location Information
The app does not access or store your deviceâ€™s location information.

###Device Information
We do not collect device-specific data. Any diagnostic or crash data collected is managed by third-party services such as Google Play, which operate under their own privacy terms.

###Service Providers
We do not collect or share any personal information. However, the app may use third-party services or APIs (e.g., Google Maps API) which may gather anonymous usage or crash data to enhance their services. These services operate under their own data handling practices.

###Security
Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no sensitive user data to protect. That said, we follow best practices to secure the app and prevent unauthorized access to its internal systems.

###Childrenâ€™s Privacy
This app is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate action to delete such data.

###Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are encouraged to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of updates by posting the new policy on this page. Changes are effective immediately upon posting.
